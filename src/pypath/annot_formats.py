#: Annotations are defined by a ``name``, a ``source`` and an ``args``
#: parameter. If the former is a string it will be first looked up among
#: the annotation resources in ``pypath.annot.db``. Otherwise among the
#: keys of the classes in the ``CustomAnnotation`` object or in the
#: dictionary of the class_definitions. If ``source`` is a `set`, it
#: will be used as a category without further processing. If it is
#: callable it will be called and should return a `set`. If
#: ``bool(args)`` is `False`, in case of annotations in
#: ``pypath.annot.db`` the ``to_set`` method will be called. Otherwise
#: ``args`` will be passed to the ``get_subset`` method. If ``source``
#: is callable, ``args`` will be passed if available.

#: Annotation operations consist of list of annotation definitions or
#: names as they can be looked up in the ``class_definitions`` of the
#: ``CustomAnnotation`` object and an operator to be called on the sets
#: (union, intersection or difference).
